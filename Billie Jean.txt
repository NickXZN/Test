She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
who will dance on the floor in the round
she said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
and every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
the one will dance on the floor in the round

people always told me be careful of what you do
and don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
and mother always told me be careful of who you love
and be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
she's just a girl who claims that I am the one
but the kid is not my son
she say's I am the one, but the kid is not my son

for forty days and forty night
the law was on her side
but who can stand when she's in demand
her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
so take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice (do think twice)

She told my baby we danced 'til three, then she looked at me
then showed a photo, my baby cried, his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
and don't go around breaking your girls' hearts
she came and stood right by me
the smell of sweet perfume
this happened much too soon
she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
she's just a girl who claims that I am the one, but the kid is not my son
